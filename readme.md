## Repo for Halo ##
# 1. Framework Selection:
 * Selected test automation framework: PLAYWRIGHT.
 * Reason: I feel most comfortable using it as it is the latest automation test framework that I have been using in my currents projects.
 * Stack: Playwright, Typescript, Page object model, lighthouse, faker.

Test cases to be automated:

# 2. Test cases to be automated for this particular home-task:

1. TC 1: [PRE-CONDITION] User signs up. --> It's needed for sign up and be logged in the system
2. TC 9: Success product purchase flow. --> Purchase flow end to end.
3. Performance and accessibility test. --> Just an add-on which I consider important when testing websites.
4. TC 10: [POST-CONDITION] Logout --> It's a complementary test case for the flow.
